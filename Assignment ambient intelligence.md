- focus on environmental intelligence, rather than on "robots". No robots were allowed in this exercise.
- focus on people, and how they can interact with the environment and/or take benefit from it
- include sensors.


The smart environment comprises a series of sensors that help people during training.

When the customer enters the gym the presence is detected by some long term sensors that communicate with the smartphone's Bluetooth, this confirms the reservation made by phone. The same happens when the presence is detected inside a specific room, the training proposed depends on it.

The training also depends on the day, some trainers are available on even days and some others on the odd days.

The body part to train is assigned depending on the wanted intensity. Bigger muscles mean higher intensity Some sensors that measure the body parameter like the heart rate adjust the train to avoid some damage or health risk.

The cool-down duration is regulated by the intensity of the previous and next to that also by the next exercise, also in this case the body parameters adjust this time interval. 

Every station is equipped with a short-term sensor, like the nfc (rfid), their aim is the revelation of the specific user giving the contact with the phone or one badge. After this phase body parameters are associated and useful.

The human-ambient interaction is very smooth, most of the sensors are low invasive, except for the embodied ones, they must be near the body.


short term sensors
long term sensors
body parameters sensors



The mix of these details improves the experience and the training of the customer
